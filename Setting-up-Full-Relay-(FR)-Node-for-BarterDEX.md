### What is Full Relay (FR) node?

Full Relay node (FR) creates the p2p network & only relays packets for BarterDEX and allows ordermatch to happen. They don't trade. FR nodes never touch any funds of any sort and are just a bulletin board. 0 balance needed to run an FR node. Bob and Alice connect to the FR network. Bob places orders and Alice fills the orders. It is ideal to have at least 3 FR nodes in each netid.

### How to setup an FR node?

It is just `marketmaker` launched with `client:0` parameter. Very easy to setup, just follow along without skipping any step.

#### Install the following dependency packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake git libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential
```

#### Install `nanomsg`

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg
cd nanomsg
cmake . -DNN_TESTS=OFF -DNN_ENABLE_DOC=OFF
make -j2
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
#### Clone the SuperNET repo from github & Install:
Clone the repo, checkout dev branch for latest and install.

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET
cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges
git checkout dev
./install
```

#### Edit the `client` script
The client script inside `cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts` should look like below to be running as an FR node.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
source passphrase
source coins
./stop
git pull;
cp ../exchanges/updateprices .;./updateprices
cd ..; 
./m_mm;
pkill -15 marketmaker; 
stdbuf -oL $1 ./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":0, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &
```
barterDEX is now installed in your system. You

#### Starting FR node

Every time you want to run Full Relay (FR) open a new terminal window and type the following:
```shell
cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts
./client &
```

### How to setup FR nodes for different netid?
You need to edit the value of `netid` in the `client` script along with `client:0` param.

##### client

```shell
#!/bin/bash
source passphrase
source coins
./stop
git pull;
cp ../exchanges/updateprices .;./updateprices
cd ..; 
./m_mm;
pkill -15 marketmaker; 
stdbuf -oL $1 ./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":0,\"netid\":1024, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &
```

#### Stopping FR node
Just use the command in any terminal session to stop marketmaker. This will stop the running FR node.

```shell
